// This file can be used for any future JavaScript functionality.

// Example: Simple Scroll-to-Top button (if needed in the future)

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // Scroll event listeners can be added here.
  // For now, the main functionality (AOS initialization) is
  // handled directly in the index.html for simplicity.
  // Any complex form validation or custom animations would go here.
});
